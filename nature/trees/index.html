  <h1>Trees</h1>

  <p>Cedars Park contains a mature and diverse collection of trees from around the world.
    Between 2019 and 2021, volunteers from the Friends of Cedars Park carried out a Tree Identification Project &mdash;
    all of the main trees have now been identified and numbered, effectively creating a formal arboretum with a
    tree listing that allows people to easily see the species of each tree.</p>
  <p>The current temporary tree tags were installed in 2019 and we are due to install permanent tags in 2023.</p>

  <p>CPRE Hertfordshire said: 'The tree project is a valuable asset helping visitors to discover the
    trees in the park. Their species lists and measurements . . . have contributed to our national
    knowledge of trees in cultivation'.</p>

  <p>To see the species of all trees in the arboretum, refer to the
    <a href="cedars-park-arboretum-tree-listing.pdf">Cedars Park Arboretum Tree Listing</a>.
  <p>Note: This Tree Listing only covers trees within the designated
    <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1uThxXqw7z7uooQM0ch86MO_Pv79IOqA&usp=sharing" target="_blank">Arboretum Zones</a>, which cover the
    majority of the park. If you would like to identify a tree outside of this area, such as in heavy
    woodland or the Wildflower Meadows, we have produced a basic
    <a href="tree-identification-guide.pdf">Tree Identification Guide</a>.</p>
  <p>As part of the tree project, we have also collated some <a href="https://treefunfacts.com" target="_blank">Tree Fun Facts</a>
    to complement this information.</p>
