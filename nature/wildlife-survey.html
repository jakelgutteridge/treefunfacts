  <h1>Wildlife Survey</h1>

    <p>This survey was commissioned by the Friends of Cedars Park and carried out by
      <a href="https://www.hertswildlifetrust.org.uk/" target="_blank">Herts & Middlesex Wildlife Trust</a> in June 2017,
      providing the Council and Friends Group with a
      broader understanding of the park's ecosystem so that it may be looked after properly.</p>

    <h2>Summary <span style="font-weight: normal;">(via <a href="https://hercinfo.org.uk/" target="_blank">Herts Environmental Records Centre</a>)</span></h2>
      
      <p>Cedars Park consists predominantly of a combination of managed semi-natural and ornamental, planted
        habitats in association with the parkland. This includes broadleaved semi-natural secondary woodland,
        broadleaved plantation woodland of recent origin, scrub, parkland, ruderal vegetation, marginal aquatic
        vegetation, eutrophic standing water, amenity grassland, and neutral grassland. The range of habitats
        present enables the park to support numerous foraging and nesting bird and invertebrate species, in
        addition to providing important semi-natural habitats for protected species such as bats and stag beetles
        in the area.</p>
      
      <p>The woodland present in the privy garden area of the park is a relatively young secondary woodland,
        compromising[sic] of both native and non-native species. The canopy is dominated by Sycamore (<i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i>)
        with frequent Yew (<i>Taxus baccata</i>), presumably derived from historical ornamental planting. Of the
        non-native species present, there is a mixture of self-set and planted individuals. The understory is
        similarly mixed, but of particular note is a localised population of Butchers Broom (<i>Ruscus aculeatus</i>)
        which is also presumably derived from historical ornamental planting. Much of the ground flora is dominated
        by species such as Ivy (<i>Hedera helix</i>) and Bramble (<i>Rubus fruticosus</i>), with some examples of developing woodland
        ground flora such as White Bryony (<i>Bryonia dioica</i>) and localised invasive or non-native species such as
        Spanish Bluebell (<i>Hyacinthoides hispanica</i>) – the latter again almost certainly derived from the original
        planting scheme. The trees and scrub around the park provide considerable resources for wildlife such as
        birds and invertebrates to forage, shelter, and nest in.</p>
      
      <p>Much of the grassland present in the park is managed as amenity grassland for the benefit of park users,
        but there is an area of neutral grassland persisting to the south of the site, beneath largely native
        planted trees. Although dominated by competitive rank grasses, there are several areas supporting good
        concentrations of forb species, such as Ox-eye Daisy (<i>Leucanthemum vulgare</i>) and Common Vetch (<i>Vicia sativa</i>),
        with a notable population of Beaked Hawk’s-beard (<i>Crepis vesicaria</i>). Unusual plants in this area include a
        good population of Grass Vetchling (<i>Lathyrus nissolia</i>) and a small area of Spotted Medick (<i>Medicago arabica</i>).
        This area of grassland has been seen to support a range of invertebrates, such as the
        Common Blue (<i>Polyommatus icarus</i>) butterfly and Buff-tailed Bumblebee (<i>Bombus terrestris</i>).</p>
      
      <p>Towards the north east of the site, where an old boating pond has since dried up, is an area of tall
      ruderal vegetation. Surrounded by scrub and centred around a small copse of young willow, much of the area is
      composed of early successional species such as Stinging Nettle (<i>Urtica dioica</i>) and Hogweed (<i>Heracleum sphondylium</i>).
      Within this are shorter, wetter areas, supporting species such as Pendulous Sedge (<i>Carex pendula</i>) and
      Great Willowherb (<i>Epilobium hirsutum</i>). Bee Orchid (<i>Ophrys apifera</i>) has also been recorded in this area, perhaps
      due to colonisation following historical disturbance of the site.</p>
      
      <p>The main pond, in the south east of the park, is bordered by a narrow fringe of vegetation, featuring both
        ornamental and naturally colonising species including Hard Rush (<i>Juncus inflexus</i>) and Flag Iris (<i>Iris pseudocorus</i>).
        The central island area is dominated by Common Reed (<i>Phragmites australis</i>). Leading off from the pond
        are two strips of tall marginal vegetation, which contain species such as Great Willowherb and
        Greater Pond Sedge (<i>Carex riparia</i>), and likely provide good habitat for ground nesting water birds such as
        Moorhen and for dragonflies and damselflies.</p>
