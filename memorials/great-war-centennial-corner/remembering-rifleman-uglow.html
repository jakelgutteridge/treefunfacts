  <p>William Ernest Taylor Uglow was the son of William Ernest and Florence Uglow, who lived
    at Beaumont View in Cheshunt. After hearing about the outbreak of the war, he enrolled himself
    in 1/9th Battalion, Queen Victoria's Rifle Brigade, a First Line Territorial Force of the London Regiment, who were part
    of the initial British Expeditionary Force of 100,000 sent to support France and Belgium against
    the invasion by the Imperial German Army according to Treaty.</p>
    
  <p>Rifleman Uglow was given the service number 1687 and following three months of training, his
    unit was sent to fight on the Western Front. They disembarked in France on 4 November 1914,
    during the First Battle of Ypres.</p>

  <p>In the early hours of 1 January 1915, while sleeping in a barn used as a temporary overnight bivouac,
    Uglow and over 40 others of his battalion were killed by an incendiary bombardment from Hooge heights
    — the shell was from either a Trench Mortar or Light Field Artillery. Many others were seriously injured.
    Rifleman Uglow was just 17 years old.
