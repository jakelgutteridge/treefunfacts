  <p>The Friends of Cedars Park are a voluntary group established in 2005 with the purpose of maintaining and improving
    our historic and beautiful park in complement to the work of Broxbourne Borough Council. Today, the group
    has made many achievements and continues to play a strong role in the care of the park.</p>
  
  <p>The Friends Group carries out a number of essential activities in the park, including assisting
  <a href="https://www.best-environmental.co.uk/" target="_blank">BEST</a>
  with the upkeep of the park; organising events and clubs; supporting the wellbeing of our community;
  encouraging a high standard of care; and increasing funding for the park.</p>

  <h2>Join</h2>
  <p>Following budget cuts to green spaces in recent years, input from the public is crucial at this time.
  As well as being highly beneficial to the overall quality of parks, Friends Groups host a wealth of health
  benefits to their members, such as increased exposure to fresh air and social interaction.</p>
  <p>To enquire about becoming a Friend, please contact the Chairman at
    <a href="mailto:chair@cedarspark.info">chair@cedarspark.info</a>. Membership is free.</p>
