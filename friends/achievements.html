    <li>
      <b>Heritage Lottery Grant</b> &ndash; The Friends Group achieved 700 volunteer days
      over three years to support a
      <a href="https://www.tnlcommunityfund.org.uk/funding/programmes/parks-for-people" target="_blank">Parks for People</a>
      grant application by Broxbourne Borough Council, and the park received Â£1.9 million in 2011.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Cedars Park Bees</b> &ndash; In recent years, the Friends Group set up a Pollination Sanctuary (apiary)
      to help revive bee populations. Fresh honey and Beekeeping Experiences are available.

    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Men's Shed</b> &ndash; We now operate a <a href="https://ukmensheds.co.uk/" target="_blank">Men's Shed</a>
      in the park. Currently we have an Office Container, which we are in the process of renovating and
      having an electricity supply connected. We are now open and try and cater for all.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Tree Identification Project</b> &ndash; Volunteers from our Friends Group recorded the species
      of over 600 trees in Cedars Park to create an arboretum with tree listing. You can find this
      information on the <a href="/nature/trees">Trees</a> page.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Memorials</b> &ndash; There is interest from the public about memorial trees and
      benches in the park, planted in memory of someone, which can be difficult to locate. We have therefore created a
      <a href="/memorials/cedars-park-memorial-listing.pdf">Memorial Listing</a> to help with this.
    </li>
  </ul>
