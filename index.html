      <h1>Tree Fun Facts</h1>
      <p>This website is dedicated to all 3 trillion trees around the world and how
        they are amazing creations of nature. Trees are extremely important to our
        planet and we hope that they can become better appreciated members of our ecosystem.</p>
      <p>In order to truly understand the value and wonder of trees, we need to
        look at them in different ways and understand the roles that they play,
        such as from mythological, historical, religious and scientific perspectives.
        They are not only the oldest living organisms in the world, but are an
        indispensable life source &ndash; as such, trees should be highly regarded
        and respected. We hope that you will find this website useful and enjoy
        expanding your knowledge about trees!</p>
