    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase;">Looking at Trees from New Perspectives</p>
    <p>This site (established 2019) is dedicated to all 3 trillion trees around the world and
      how they are amazing creations of nature. Trees are extremely important to our planet and
      we hope that they can become better appreciated members of our ecosystem.</p>
    <p>In order to truly understand the value and wonder of trees, we need to look at them in
      different ways and understand the roles that they play, such as from mythological,
      historical, religious and scientific perspectives. They are not only the oldest
      living organisms in the world, but are an indispensable life source – as such, trees
      should be highly regarded and respected.</p>
    <p>We hope that you will find this website useful and enjoy expanding your knowledge about trees.</p>
