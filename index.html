      <p>This website is dedicated to all 3 trillion trees around the world and how
    they are amazing creations of nature. Trees are extremely important to our
    planet and we hope that they can become better appreciated members of our ecosystem.</p>
      <p>In order to truly understand the value and wonder of trees, we need to
    look at them in different ways and understand the roles that they play,
    such as from mythological, historical, religious and scientific perspectives.
    They are not only the oldest living organisms in the world, but are an
    indispensable life source &ndash; as such, trees should be highly regarded
    and respected. We hope that you will find this website useful and enjoy
    expanding your knowledge about trees!</p>
