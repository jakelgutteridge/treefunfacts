  <h1>Covenant</h1>

    <p>In 1919, Admiral of the Fleet Sir Hedworth Meux generously donated his grounds
       east of what is now the A10 road for the enjoyment of the public of Cheshunt.
       The handover to Cheshunt Urban District Council was made official by a covenant
       signed by Meux, providing an outline to the council on how the park should be managed and used.
       Today, Broxbourne Borough Council manages Cheshunt and its public parks.</p>
