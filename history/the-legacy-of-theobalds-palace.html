    <li>Theobalds Lane is named after the palace and contains the remains of the main buildings.</li>
    <li>Theobalds Brook, a minor tributary of the River Lea, passes through the former palace grounds.</li>
    <li>An entire ward of the borough is named Cheshunt South & Theobalds, showing the prominence of the palace in the area.</li>
    <li>Hedworth Avenue and Lambton Avenue are named after Admiral of the Fleet Sir Hedworth Meux (n√© Lambton), who lived at Theobalds Park and donated Cedars Park to the people of Cheshunt in 1919.</li>
    <li>Lady Meux is known to have entertained Sir Winston Churchill in the upper chamber of Temple Bar
      (when it was located at Theobalds Park) and a dual carriageway, immediately south of Cedars Park, has been named after him.<li>
      The story told in the early 17th century ballad of
      <a href="https://www.enfieldsociety.org.uk/documents/KingandTinker.pdf" target="_blank">The King and the Tinker</a>
      took place at the pub on Whitewebbs Lane, Enfield &mdash; now called
      The King and Tinker &mdash;
      which stood on the extensive deer hunting grounds of Theobalds Palace. It describes King James I becoming separated from his courtiers while out
      on a hunt at Theobalds and taking refuge in an alehouse, where he enjoyed a drink with a tinker.
      The tinker only realised who his drinking partner was when the courtiers caught up with the King.
