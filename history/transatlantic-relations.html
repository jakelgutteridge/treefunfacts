    <p>Cedars Park has a longstanding relationship with the United States. The town of Waltham,
       <abbr title="Massachusetts">MA</abbr> was established in 1634 by settlers from Waltham Cross, England.</p>

    <p>In August 1930, the Chairman of Cheshunt Urban District Council (Joseph B. Franklin Esq.) visited the
       American Waltham for an early celebration of the tercentenary of the town's founding. He was gifted an
       Amur cork tree, which was planted in Cedars Park on his return home â€” reportedly the only one in England.</p>

    <p>This was followed up in 1941 with additional gifts from America to England of a mobile canteen worth $1500
       ($21,000 today) to Waltham Cross and Waltham Abbey, which were joint at the time. A prominent American Walthamite
       wrote to the Chairman of the Council: <q>We Americans admire the gallant fight you Englishmen are making for the cause of democracy</q></p>

    <p>After the tree died from storm damage, the American Waltham kindly donated a new one in August 1980, which later died.</p>

    <p>In recent years a new tree was planted, but unfortunately it was severely ring-barked in 2019 (likely by muntjacs)
       and died in 2020, despite

  <h2>Newspaper article</h2>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>Residents of Waltham, Mass., U.S.A., have decided to show their sympathy with their namesake town,
    Waltham Abbey, Essex, by providing, at a cost of 1,500 dollars, a mobile canteen for the use of the joint parishes
    of Waltham Abbey and Waltham Cross.  Further practical help is also promised.</p>
    <p>The American Waltham, a town of about 50,000 inhabitants, takes its name from this Essex locality, from which many of
      its original settlers came.  The news of the gift was read by Mr J. B. Franklin, J.P. who ten years ago, when chairman of
      the local Urban Council, visited America as the guest of Waltham, Mass., on the occasion of that town's tercentenary.</p>
    <p>Some years ago the American city presented an Amur cork tree to Waltham Cross, and this rare plant, the only one of
      its kind in this country, is flourishing in the Cedars Park, Waltham Cross.</p>
    <p>A prominent American Walthamite, writing to Mr J. B. Franklin, says: "We Americans admire the gallant fight you Englishmen are making for the cause of democracy."</p>
