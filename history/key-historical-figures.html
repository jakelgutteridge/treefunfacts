  <h1>Key Historical Figures</h1>

  <p>Theobalds Palace, which stood on the site of Cedars Park, accommodated several greatly
    significant people over the years, including English royals and nobility & their
    counterparts from various other countries. Below are shown the most notable people.</p>

  <h2>Sir William Cecil</h2>

    <p>Sir William Cecil was Queen Elizabeth I's Chief Advisor for most of her reign. He bought
       Theobalds in 1563 and accommodated the Queen on many occasions throughout the late 16th century.</p>

    <p>On one of the Queen's visits in 1571, Cecil gifted her a drawing of the house. He was
       elevated to the Peerage the same year, becoming the Lord High Treasurer (Lord Burleigh),
       1 of just 15 noblemen during the Elizabethan period.</p>

    <p>When Elizabeth visited the Palace in 1593, Cecil spent some 2500 pounds entertaining her!</p>

  <h2>Queen Elizabeth I</h2>

  </a>

    <p>Elizabeth I stayed at Theobalds at least 15 times under the care of Sirs William and
       Robert Cecil. Outdoor entertainments were usually held in the Great Garden, where there
       were elaborate fountains and garden buildings to impress guests.</p>

  <br clear="all">

  <h2>Sir Robert Cecil</h2>

        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </a>

    <p>Following the death of his father William in 1598, Sir Robert Cecil inherited Theobalds.
       King James I arrived at the Palace for the first time on 3 May 1603 and Cecil looked
       after him and his associates.</p>

    <p>Cecil accommodated James I (of England) & Christian IV of Denmark for 5 days in 1606.
       The organised entertainments did not go to plan as most of the participants had been
       drinking heavily prior to the performance. Hosting this visit is reported to have cost
       Cecil 1487 pounds.</p>

  <br clear="all">

  <h2>King James I</h2>

  <a href="/images/james.jpg" data-fancybox="gallery" data-caption="King James I">
    <table class="image-table-right">
      <tr>
        <td>

  </a>

    <p>James I first visited Theobalds in 1603. He swapped Hatfield House with Robert Cecil in exchange for Theobalds in 1607.
       He had a 2500-acre deer hunting ground created and enjoyed many hunting sessions at
       Theobalds &mdash; this was a favourite pastime of the Royal Family during the 17th century.
       The estate was enclosed by a 10-mile long brick wall in 1620.</p>

    <p>On an evening ride on 9 January 1622, he fell into the icy New River and was helped out
       by Sir Richard Young, who returned him to a warm bed at Theobalds.</p>

    <p>Theobalds Palace was the King's favourite estate, where he spent much of his later life
       and died on 27 March 1625 from a stroke following a bout of poor health.</p>

  <br clear="all">

  <h2>Mountain Jennings</h2>

  <p>Mountain Jennings (actual name Munten) was Robert Cecil's gardener at Theobalds until James I
     acquired the estate. He then worked at both Theobalds and Hatfield House. Jennings heavily
     expanded Theobalds on the orders of King James I, turning it into a grand palace.</p>

  <br>
  

  <h2>King Charles I</h2>

        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </a>

    <p>Charles inherited Theobalds from James I. The palace was conveniently located near to London
       â€” after a failed attempt to arrest five Members of Parliament on 4 January 1642, Charles fled to Theobalds.</p>

    <p>Despite a very happy childhood at Theobalds, the King had complained in 1624 that
       "there is no kind of field-hawking there", although he added several carvings and paintings of
       stag heads to the Great Gallery, suggesting that he spent time there and wanted to impress
       visitors.</p>

  <br clear="all">

  <h2>Major-General William Packer</h2>

  <p>To support the troops during the English Civil War, Major-General William Packer sold the lead from
     buildings at Theobalds that had either been demolished for this purpose or destroyed in the war.
     It is believed that George Prescott used the remaining unsold materials to build Theobalds Square over a century later.</p>

  <h2>Admiral of the Fleet Sir Hedworth Meux</h2>

        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </a>

  <p>Admiral Sir Hedworth Meux inherited the Theobalds estate in 1910. In 1919, he donated
       The Cedars to the local District Council by covenant to be used as a public park for the
       enjoyment of the people of Cheshunt. The park opened in 1921.</p>

  <p>Admiral Meux is buried in Cheshunt Cemetery on Bury Green Road.</p>
